I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst specializing in threat detection, incident response, and log analysis. My hands-on projects showcase my ability to emulate real-world cyber threats, automate security workflows, and analyze malicious activity using industry-leading tools like Splunk, Sysmon, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I am dedicated to advancing organizational cybersecurity and staying ahead of emerging threats.

## Objective

To secure a Cybersecurity Analyst role where I can leverage my skills in threat detection, incident response, and security automation to protect organizational infrastructure from evolving cyber threats.

## Projects Overview

### Threat Vector: Simulated Attack Detection and Analysis  
- Simulated attack scenarios in a virtual environment using Windows 10 and Kali Linux.  
- Configured Sysmon and Splunk for monitoring and detection of various attack vectors.  
- Developed custom Splunk alerts and correlation searches to identify malicious activity.  
- Documented findings and mapped detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  

### Automated SOC Workflow: Threat Detection, Intelligence Enrichment, and Incident Response  
- Deployed Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to automate threat detection, enrichment, and incident response.  
- Created custom rules for Mimikatz detection and enriched intelligence via VirusTotal.  
- Configured real-time email alerts and streamlined case creation workflows.  

### Detecting Evil with Splunk and MITRE ATT&CK  
- Executed Atomic Red Team tests to simulate adversary techniques (e.g., BITS Job and PowerShell Execution).  
- Created Splunk queries to detect malicious activity and differentiate false positives from real threats.  
- Applied MITRE ATT&CK guidelines to refine detection rules and enhance SOC workflows.  

### Event ID 4688: Properly Logging Process Creation  
- Configured Windows Event ID 4688 logging via Group Policy to track process creation and command-line arguments.  
- Demonstrated practical tests to monitor process behavior and detect reconnaissance activities.  
- Highlighted the importance of filtering noisy data and leveraging Security Event Viewer effectively.  

## Supplementary Contributions  

### Bybit Heist Analysis  
- Conducted a detailed analysis of the 2025 Bybit cryptocurrency heist, which saw $1.5 billion stolen through social engineering and AWS token theft.  
- Mapped attacker tactics to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, from credential harvesting to defense evasion and UI manipulation.  
- Provided insights into vulnerabilities, defensive strategies, and lessons learned to prevent similar incidents.
